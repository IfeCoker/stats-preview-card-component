## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

CSS flexbox and CSS web font

```css
.card {
    background-color: hsl(244, 38%, 16%);
    width: 100rem;
    height: 44rem;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: flex-start;
    align-items: center;
    border-radius: 10px;
    overflow: hidden;
}

@font-face {
    font-family: myFirstfont;
    src: url(https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter);
}
```

### Continued development

CSS flexbox layout module. To design flexible responsive layout structure.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for my CSS styling; using flexbox, web fonts, css filter property, and css gradients. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
